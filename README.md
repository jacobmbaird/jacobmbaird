### About me

I am a cloud platform engineer at the Royal Bank of Canada. My office is in Toronto, but I work from home full-time in Scarborough.

I grew up in Rusagonis, New Brunswick, Canada and studied computer science at the University of New Brunswick.
I was drawn to the big city by the sight of towering skyscrapers making up Toronto's skyline, along with its cultural offerings.

I am interested in history, Earth science, biology, the English language, architecture and physics.

### My projects

I am creating an open-source, digital museum where users can contribute to an historical record of Earth's past and create immersive, 3D experiences.
